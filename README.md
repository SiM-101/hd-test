# Hastings Direct Test

Hello! Thank you for the opportunity of taking this test! I hope you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.

A live demo is available in this repository in the form of GitHub Pages [here](https://sim-101.github.io/hd-test/)

## Installing

You may clone the repository to your machine by doing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/SiM-101/hd-test.git
```

My package manager of choice is yarn, but you may use npm if you prefer.

Install the depenencies with

```shell
yarn
```

and then you are ready to start a development build

```shell
yarn dev
```

Included in the package there is also storybook

```shell
yarn storybook
```

And finally you want to compile the webpage

```shell
yarn build
```

The output will be in the `docs` folder while the `dist` folder is for the webpack-dev-server output.
